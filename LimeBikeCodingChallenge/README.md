I have used Java as my choice of language to solve this problem
I have developed this using Eclipse so you could either run the code there, or follow the following steps on any Linux machine:

cd into the directory containing the code,
javac ItemCounter.java
java ItemCounter

Regarding inputs:
I have hard coded the inputs by creating "Ride" objects
The Items for each ride need a space after each ',' since I'm parsing it that way
The Timestamps for each ride are "hh:mm" string inputs that are being converted to date objects in the code
I've also commented the code for easy understanding of my thought process. Hope it helps
